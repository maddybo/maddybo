# Magda Bo
Hey there, internet friends! 🖐️ I'm Magda from Europe. First of all, let's get one thing straight - I'm a coding ninja. 💻 I love nothing more than tinkering with code and creating awesome things that make people go "wow!" 😎

But back to the code. I'm a master of Vue, NodeJS (NestJS and pure expressJS) and Unity. and I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set. So if you've got a cool project you need help with, I'm your person! 👩‍💻👨‍💻


- 🔭 I’m currently working on Chatbot @ Livechat 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open source Projects
- 💪 Team: Apple, Xbox, Nintendo
- 🤔 Traveler, Feminist and Gamer

My dream tech stack
- VUE3 (composition api)
- NestJS
- GraphQL
- PostgreSQL

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my Github page. Let's connect and create some epic stuff together! 🚀
